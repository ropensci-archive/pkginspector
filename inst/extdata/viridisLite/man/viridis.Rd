\usage{
viridis(n, alpha = 1, begin = 0, end = 1, direction = 1, option = "D")

viridisMap(n = 256, alpha = 1, begin = 0, end = 1, direction = 1,
  option = "D")

magma(n, alpha = 1, begin = 0, end = 1, direction = 1)

inferno(n, alpha = 1, begin = 0, end = 1, direction = 1)

plasma(n, alpha = 1, begin = 0, end = 1, direction = 1)

cividis(n, alpha = 1, begin = 0, end = 1, direction = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{The number of colors (\eqn{\ge 1}) to be in the palette.}

\item{alpha}{The alpha transparency, a number in [0,1], see argument alpha in
\code{\link[grDevices]{hsv}}.}

\item{begin}{The (corrected) hue in [0,1] at which the viridis colormap begins.}

\item{end}{The (corrected) hue in [0,1] at which the viridis colormap ends.}

\item{direction}{Sets the order of colors in the scale. If 1, the default, colors
are ordered from darkest to lightest. If -1, the order of colors is reversed.}

\item{option}{A character string indicating the colormap option to use. Five
options are available: "magma" (or "A"), "inferno" (or "B"), "plasma" (or "C"),
"viridis" (or "D", the default option) and "cividis" (or "E").}
}
\value{
\code{viridis} returns a character vector, \code{cv}, of color hex
codes. This can be used either to create a user-defined color palette for
subsequent graphics by \code{palette(cv)}, a \code{col =} specification in
graphics functions or in \code{par}.

\code{viridisMap} returns a \code{n} lines data frame containing the
red (\code{R}), green (\code{G}), blue (\code{B}) and alpha (\code{alpha})
channels of \code{n} equally spaced colors along the 'viridis' color map.
\code{n = 256} by default, which corresponds to the data from the original
'viridis' color map in Matplotlib.
}
\description{
This function creates a vector of \code{n} equally spaced colors along the
Matplolib 'viridis' color map created by \href{https://github.com/stefanv}{Stéfan van der Walt}
and \href{https://github.com/njsmith}{Nathaniel Smith}. This color map is
designed in such a way that it will analytically be perfectly perceptually-uniform,
both in regular form and also when converted to black-and-white. It is also
designed to be perceived by readers with the most common form of color blindness.
}
\details{
A corrected version of 'viridis', 'cividis', was developed by
\href{https://github.com/jamienunez}{Jamie R. Nuñez} and
\href{https://github.com/smcolby}{Sean M. Colby}. It is optimal for viewing by
those with color vision deficiency. 'cividis' is designed to be perfectly
perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted to
black-and-white, and can be perceived by readers with all forms of color
blindness.



\if{html}{Here are the color scales:

  \out{<div style="text-align: center">}\figure{viridis-scales.png}{options: style="width:750px;max-width:90\%;"}\out{</div>}

  }
\if{latex}{Here are the color scales:

  \out{\begin{center}}\figure{viridis-scales.png}\out{\end{center}}
  }

\code{magma()}, \code{plasma()}, \code{inferno()} and \code{cividis()} are
convenience functions for the other colormap options, which are useful the
scale must be passed as a function name.

Semi-transparent colors (\eqn{0 < alpha < 1}) are supported only on some
devices: see \code{\link[grDevices]{rgb}}.
