[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) recently [introduced new color maps]
(http://matplotlib.org/style_changes.html) for their graphs. They are called
`viridis`, `magma`, `inferno`, and `plasma`. `viridis` was made the new default 
color map of Matplotlib. 

These four color maps are designed in such a way that they will analytically be 
perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted to 
black-and-white. They are also designed to be perceived by readers with the most 
common form of color blindness. 

AND... they are pretty!

AND... they are now available for R! 

> **NOTE**: `viridisLite` is the 'lite' version of the more complete 
> [`viridis` package](https://github.com/sjmgarnier/viridis). `viridisLite` contains
> only the core functions of `viridis` that generate the color vectors for each 
> of the aforementioned color maps. It does not have any of the other features of
> the full `viridis` package (e.g. scale functions for `ggplot2`). This was 
> requested by users of `viridis` who did not want to have to import the dependencies 
> of `viridis` but still wanted to be able to use the color maps it provides.

#### Look how pretty they are!
